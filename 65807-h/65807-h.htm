  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>During the last three or four years there has been a remarkable
renascence of poetry in both America and England, and an equally
extraordinary revival of public interest in the art.</p>

<p class='c007'>The editors of this anthology wish to present in convenient form
representative work of the poets who are to-day creating what is
commonly called “the new poetry,”—a phrase no doubt rash and
most imperfectly descriptive, since the new in art is always the
elder old, but one difficult to replace with any form of words more
exact. Much newspaper controversy, and a number of special
magazines, testify to the demand for such a book; also many letters
to the editors of <cite>Poetry</cite> asking for information—letters not only
from individual lovers of the art, but also from college professors
and literary clubs or groups, who have begun to feel that the poetry
of to-day is a vital force no longer to be ignored. Indeed, many
critics feel that poetry is coming nearer than either the novel or
the drama to the actual life of to-day. The magazine <cite>Poetry</cite>,
ever since its foundation in October, 1912, has encouraged this
new spirit in the art, and the anthology is a further effort on the
part of its editors to present the new spirit to the public.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is the new poetry? and wherein does it differ from the
old? The difference is not in mere details of form, for much poetry
infused with the new spirit conforms to the old measures and
rhyme-schemes. It is not merely in diction, though the truly
modern poet rejects the so-called “poetic” shifts of language—the
<em>deems</em>, <em>’neaths</em>, <em>forsooths</em>, etc., the inversions and high-sounding
rotundities, familiar to his predecessors: all the rhetorical excesses
through which most Victorian poetry now seems “over-apparelled,”
as a speaker at a <cite>Poetry</cite> dinner—a lawyer, not a
poet—put it in pointing out what the new movement is aiming at.
These things are important, but the difference goes deeper than details
of form, strikes through them to fundamental integrities.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>The new poetry strives for a concrete and immediate realization
of life; it would discard the theory, the abstraction, the remoteness,
found in all classics not of the first order. It is less vague, less
verbose, less eloquent, than most poetry of the Victorian period
and much work of earlier periods. It has set before itself an ideal
of absolute simplicity and sincerity—an ideal which implies an
individual, unstereotyped diction; and an individual, unstereotyped
rhythm. Thus inspired, it becomes intensive rather than
diffuse. It looks out more eagerly than in; it becomes objective.
The term “exteriority” has been applied to it, but this is incomplete.
In presenting the concrete object or the concrete environment,
whether these be beautiful or ugly, it seeks to give more
precisely the emotion arising from them, and thus widens immeasurably
the scope of the art.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this implies no disrespect for tradition. The poets of to-day
do not discard tradition because they follow the speech of to-day
rather than that of Shakespeare’s time, or strive for organic rhythm
rather than use a mold which has been perfected by others. On the
contrary, they follow the great tradition when they seek a vehicle
suited to their own epoch and their own creative mood, and resolutely
reject all others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Great poetry has always been written in the language of contemporary
speech, and its theme, even when legendary, has always
borne a direct relation with contemporary thought, contemporary
imaginative and spiritual life. It is this direct relation which the
more progressive modern poets are trying to restore. In this
effort they discard not only archaic diction but also the shop-worn
subjects of past history or legend, which have been through the
centuries a treasure-trove for the second-rate.</p>

<p class='c007'>This effort at modern speech, simplicity of form, and authentic
vitality of theme, is leading our poets to question the authority of
the accepted laws of English verse, and to study other languages,
ancient and modern, in the effort to find out what poetry really is.
It is a strange fact that, in the common prejudice of cultivated
people during the four centuries from just before 1400 to just
before 1800, nothing was accepted as poetry in English that did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>walk in the iambic measure. Bits of Elizabethan song and of
Dryden’s two musical odes, both beating four-time instead of the
iambic three, were outlandish intrusions too slight to count. To
write English poetry, a man must measure his paces according to
the iambic foot-rule; and he must mark off his lines with rhymes, or
at least marshal them in the pentameter movement of blank verse.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first protest against this prejudice, which long usage had
hardened into law, came in the persons of four or five great poets—Burns,
Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Byron—who puzzled the ears of
their generation with anapæsts and other four-time measures, and
who carried into their work a certain immediacy of feeling and
imagery—a certain modern passion of life—which even Cowper,
Thompson and a few others of their time, though they had written
of things around them, had scarcely attained. Quarterly critics
and London moralists blinked and gasped, but at last the bars
had to go down for these great radicals. And before long the
extreme virtuosity of Swinburne had widened still further the
musical range of the English language.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the time Whitman appeared, the ear of the average reader—that
formidable person—was attuned to anapæsts, dactyls,
choriambics, sapphics, rhymed or unrhymed. He could not call
them by name, but he was docile to all possible intricacies of
pattern in any closely woven metrical scheme. But Whitman gave
him a new shock. Here was a so-called poet who discarded all
traditional patterns, and wove a carpet of his own. Once more the
conservatives protested: was this poetry? and, if so, why? If
poetry was not founded on the long-accepted metrical laws, then
how could they distinguish it from prose, and thus keep the labels
and catalogues in order? What was Whitman’s alleged poetry but
a kind of freakish prose, invented to set forth a dangerous anarchistic
philosophy?</p>

<p class='c007'>It would take too long to analyze the large rhythms of Whitman’s
free verse; but the mere fact that he wrote free verse and
called it poetry, and that other poets—men like Rossetti, Swinburne,
Symonds, even the reluctant Emerson—seemed to agree
that it was poetry, this fact alone was, in the opinion of the conservatives,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>a challenge to four centuries of English poets. And this
challenge, repeated by later poets, compels us to inquire briefly
into the origins of English poetry, in the effort to get behind and
underneath the instinctive prejudice that English poetry, to be
poetry, must conform to prescribed metres.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chaucer, great genius that he was, an aristocrat by birth and
breeding, and a democrat by feeling and sympathy—Chaucer may
have had it in his power to turn the whole stream of English poetry
into either the French or the Anglo-Saxon channel. Knowing and
loving the old French epics better than the Norse sagas, he naturally
chose the French channel, and he was so great and so beloved
that his world followed him. Thus there was no longer any
question—the iambic measure and rhyme, both dear to the French-trained
ears of England’s Norman masters, became fixed as the
standard type of poetic form.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it was possibly a toss-up—the scale hung almost even in that
formative fourteenth century. If Chaucer’s contemporary Langland—the
great democrat, revolutionist, mystic—had had Chaucer’s
authority and universal sympathy, English poetry might
have followed his example instead of Chaucer’s; and Shakespeare,
Milton and the rest might have been impelled by common practice
to use—or modify—the curious, heavy, alliterative measure of
<cite>Piers Ploughman</cite>, which now sounds so strange to our ears:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In a somer seson,</div>
      <div class='line'>When softe was the sonne,</div>
      <div class='line'>I shoop me into shroudes</div>
      <div class='line'>As I a sheep weere;</div>
      <div class='line'>In habite as an heremite</div>
      <div class='line'>Unholy of werkes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wente wide in this world</div>
      <div class='line'>Wondres to here.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Though we must rejoice that Chaucer prevailed with his French
forms, Langland reminds us that poetry—even English poetry—is
older than rhyme, older than the iambic measure, older than all the
metrical patterns which now seem so much a part of it. If our
criticism is to have any value, it must insist upon the obvious truth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>that poetry existed before the English language began to form itself
out of the débris of other tongues, and that it now exists in forms of
great beauty among many far-away peoples who never heard of our special rules.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the first of these disturbing influences from afar to be
felt in modern English poetry was the Celtic renascence, the wonderful
revival of interest in old Irish song, which became manifest
in translations and adaptations of the ancient Gaelic lyrics and epics,
made by W. B. Yeats, Lady Gregory, Douglas Hyde and others.</p>

<p class='c007'>This influence was most powerful because it came to us directly,
not at second-hand, through the English work of two poets of
genius, Synge and Yeats. These great men, fortified and inspired
by the simplicity and clarity of primitive Celtic song, had little
patience with the “over-appareled” art of Tennyson and his
imitators. They found it stiffened by rhetoric, by a too conscious
morality leading to pulpit eloquence, and by second-hand bookish
inspirations; and its movement they found hampered, thwarted of
freedom, by a too slavish acceptance of ready-made schemes of
metre and rhyme. The surprises and irregularities, found in all
great art because they are inherent in human feeling, were being
ruled out of English poetry, which consequently was stiffening
into forms too fixed and becoming more and more remote
from life. As Mr. Yeats said in Chicago:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We were weary of all this. We wanted to get rid not only of
rhetoric but of poetic diction. We tried to strip away everything
that was artificial, to get a style like speech, as simple as the simplest
prose, like a cry of the heart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is scarcely too much to say that “the new poetry”—if we
may be allowed the phrase—began with these two great Irish
masters. Think what a contrast to even the simplest lyrics of
Tennyson the pattern of their songs presents, and what a contrast
their direct outright human feeling presents to the somewhat
culture-developed optimism of Browning, and the science-inspired
pessimism of Arnold. Compared with these Irishmen the best
of their predecessors seem literary. This statement does not imply
any measure of ultimate values, for it is still too early to estimate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>them. One may, for example, believe Synge to be the greatest
poet-playwright in English since Shakespeare, and one of the
great poets of the world; but a few more decades must pass before
such ranking can have authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same time other currents were influencing progressive
minds toward even greater freedom of form. Strangely enough,
Whitman’s influence was felt first in France. It reached England,
and finally America, indirectly from Paris, where the poets, stimulated
by translations of the great American, especially Bajazette’s,
and by the ever-adventurous quality of French scholarship, have
been experimenting with free verse ever since Mallarmé. The
great Irish poets felt the French influence—it was part of the
education which made them realize that English poetry had become
narrow, rigid, and insular. Yeats has held usually, though
never slavishly, to rhyme and a certain regularity of metrical
form—in which, however, he makes his own tunes; but Synge
wrote his plays in that wide borderland between prose and verse,
in a form which, whatever one calls it, is essentially poetry, for it
has passion, glamour, magic, rhythm, and glorious imaginative life.</p>

<p class='c007'>This borderland between prose and verse is being explored now
as never before in English; except, perhaps in the King James
translation of the Bible. The modern “vers-libertines,” as they
have been wittily called, are doing pioneer work in an heroic effort
to get rid of obstacles that have hampered the poet and separated
him from his audience. They are trying to make the modern
manifestations of poetry less a matter of rules and formulæ, and
more a thing of the spirit, and of organic as against imposed,
rhythm. In this enthusiastic labor they are following not only a
strong inward impulse, not only the love of freedom which Chaucer
followed—and Spenser and Shakespeare, Shelley and Coleridge
and all the masters—but they are moved also by influences from
afar. They have studied the French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">symbolistes</span></i> of the ’nineties,
and the more recent Parisian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers-libristes</span></i>. Moreover, some of
them have listened to the pure lyricism of the Provençal troubadours,
have studied the more elaborate mechanism of early
Italian sonneteers and canzonists, have read Greek poetry from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>new angle of vision; and last, but perhaps most important of all,
have bowed to winds from the East.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the nineteenth century the western world—the western
æsthetic world—discovered the orient. Someone has said that
when Perry knocked at the gates of Japan, these opened, not to
let us in, but to let the Japanese out. Japanese graphic art, especially,
began almost at once to kindle progressive minds. Whistler,
of course, was the first great creative artist to feel the influence of
their instinct for balance and proportion, for subtle harmonies of
color and line, for the integrity of beauty in art as opposed to the
moralizing and sentimental tendencies which had been intruding
more and more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Poetry was slower than the graphic arts to feel the oriental influence,
because of the barrier of language. But European scholarship
had long dabbled with Indian, Persian and Sanskrit literatures,
and Fitzgerald even won over the crowd to some remote suspicion
of their beauty by meeting Omar half-way, and making a great
poem out of the marriage, not only of two minds, but of two
literary traditions. Then a few airs from Japan blew in—a few
translations of <i><span lang="ja-latn" xml:lang="ja-latn">hokku</span></i> and other forms—which showed the stark
simplicity and crystal clarity of the art among Japanese poets.
And of late the search has gone further: we begin to discover a
whole royal line of Chinese poets of a thousand or more years ago;
and we are trying to search out the secrets of their delicate and
beautiful art. The task is difficult, because our poets, ignorant of
Chinese, have to get at these masters through the literal translations
of scholars. But even by this round-about way, poets like
Allen Upward, Ezra Pound, Helen Waddell and a few others, give
us something of the rare flavor, the special exquisite perfume, of the
original. And of late the Indian influence has been emphasized by
the great Bengali poet and sage, Rabindranath Tagore, whose
mastery of English makes him a poet in two languages.</p>

<p class='c007'>This oriental influence is to be welcomed because it flows from
deep original streams of poetic art. We should not be afraid to
learn from it; and in much of the work of the imagists, and other
radical groups, we find a more or less conscious, and more or less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>effective, yielding to that influence. We find something of the
oriental directness of vision and simplicity of diction, also now and
then a hint of the unobtrusive oriental perfection of form
and delicacy of feeling.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these influences, which tend to make the art of poetry, especially
poetry in English, less provincial, more cosmopolitan, are
by no means a defiance of the classic tradition. On the contrary,
they are an endeavor to return to it at its great original sources, and
to sweep away artificial laws—the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">obiter dicta</span></i> of secondary minds—which
have encumbered it. There is more of the great authentic
classic tradition, for example, in the <cite>Spoon River Anthology</cite> than in
the <cite>Idylls of the King</cite>, <cite>Balaustian’s Adventure</cite>, and <cite>Sohrab and
Rustum</cite> combined. And the free rhythms of Whitman, Mallarmé,
Pound, Sandburg and others, in their inspired passages, are more
truly in line with the biblical, the Greek, the Anglo-Saxon, and
even the Shakespearean tradition, than all the exact iambics of
Dryden and Pope, the patterned alexandrines of Racine, or the
closely woven metrics of Tennyson and Swinburne.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whither the new movement is leading no one can tell with
exactness, nor which of its present manifestations in England and
America will prove permanently valuable. But we may be sure
that the movement is toward greater freedom of spirit and form,
and a more enlightened recognition of the international scope, the
cosmopolitanism, of the great art of poetry, of which the English
language, proud as its record is, offers but a single phase. As part
of such a movement, even the most extravagant experiments, the
most radical innovations, are valuable, for the moment at least, as
an assault against prejudice. And some of the radicals of to-day
will be, no doubt, the masters of to-morrow—a phenomenon common
in the history of the arts.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c007'>It remains only to explain the plan of this anthology, its inclusions
and omissions.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has seemed best to include no poems published before 1900,
even though, as in a few cases, the poets were moved by the new
impulses. For example, those two intensely modern, nobly impassioned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>lyric poets, Emily Dickinson and the Shropshire Lad
(Alfred Edward Housman)—the one dead, the other fortunately
still living—both belong, by date of publication, to the ’nineties.
The work of poets already, as it were, enshrined—whether by
fame, or death, or both—has also not been quoted: poets whose
works are already, in a certain sense, classics, and whose books are
treasured by all lovers of the art—like Synge and Moody and Riley,
too early gone from us, and William Butler Yeats, whose later verse
is governed, even more than his earlier, by the new austerities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Certain other omissions are more difficult to explain, because
they may be thought to imply a lack of consideration which we do
not feel. The present Laureate, Robert Bridges, even in the late
’eighties and early ’nineties, was led by his own personal taste,
especially in his <cite>Shorter Poems</cite>, toward austere simplicity of subject,
diction and style. But his most representative poems were
written before 1900. Rudyard Kipling has been inspired at times
by the modern muse, but his best poems also antedate 1900.
This is true also of Louise Imogen Guiney and Bliss Carman,
though most of their work, like that of Arthur Symons and the
late Stephen Phillips and Anna Hempstead Branch, belongs, by
its affinities, to the earlier period. And Alfred Noyes, whatever
the date of his poems, bears no immediate relation to the more
progressive modern movement in the art.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, we have tried to be hospitable to the adventurous,
the experimental, because these are the qualities of
pioneers, who look forward, not backward, and who may lead on,
further than we can see as yet, to new domains of the ever-conquering
spirit of beauty.</p>

<p class='c010'><em><span class='sc'>Note.</span> A word about the typography of this volume. No rigid system of
lineation, indention, etc., has been imposed upon the poets who very kindly
lend us their work. For example, sonnets are printed with or without indention
according to the individual preference of the poet; also other rhymed
forms, such as quatrains rhyming alternately; as well as various forms of
free verse. Punctuation and spelling are more uniform, although a certain
liberty has been conceded in words like</em> gray <em>or</em> grey, <em>the color of which seems

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There he moved, cropping the grass at the purple canyon’s lip.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His mane was mixed with the moonlight that silvered his snow-white side,</div>
      <div class='line'>For the moon sailed out of a cloud with the wake of a spectral ship.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I crouched and I crawled on my belly, my lariat coil looped wide.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Dimly and dark the mesas broke on the starry sky.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A pall covered every color of their gorgeous glory at noon.</div>
      <div class='line'>I smelt the yucca and mesquite, and stifled my heart’s quick cry,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And wormed and crawled on my belly to where he moved against the moon!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Some Moorish barb was that mustang’s sire. His lines were beyond all wonder.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From the prick of his ears to the flow of his tail he ached in my throat and eyes.</div>
      <div class='line'>Steel and velvet grace! As the prophet says, God had “clothed his neck with thunder.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Oh, marvelous with the drifting cloud he drifted across the skies!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And then I was near at hand—crouched, and balanced, and cast the coil;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the moon was smothered in cloud, and the rope through my hands with a rip!</div>
      <div class='line'>But somehow I gripped and clung, with the blood in my brain aboil,—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With a turn round the rugged tree-stump there on the purple canyon’s lip.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Right into the stars he reared aloft, his red eye rolling and raging.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He whirled and sunfished and lashed, and rocked the earth to thunder and flame.</div>
      <div class='line'>He squealed like a regular devil horse. I was haggard and spent and aging—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Roped clean, but almost storming clear, his fury too fierce to tame.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And I cursed myself for a tenderfoot moon-dazzled to play the part,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But I was doubly desperate then, with the posse pulled out from town,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or I’d never have tried it. I only knew I must get a mount and a start.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The filly had snapped her foreleg short. I had had to shoot her down.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So there he struggled and strangled, and I snubbed him around the tree.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nearer, a little nearer—hoofs planted, and lolling tongue—</div>
      <div class='line'>Till a sudden slack pitched me backward. He reared right on top of me.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Mother of God—that moment! He missed me&nbsp;... and up I swung.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Somehow, gone daft completely and clawing a bunch of his mane,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As he stumbled and tripped in the lariat, there I was—up and astride</div>
      <div class='line'>And cursing for seven counties! And the mustang? <em>Just insane!</em></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Crack-bang! went the rope; we cannoned off the tree—then—gods, that ride!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A rocket—that’s all, a rocket! I dug with my teeth and nails.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Why, we never hit even the high spots (though I hardly remember things),</div>
      <div class='line'>But I heard a monstrous booming like a thunder of flapping sails</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When he spread—well, <em>call</em> me a liar!—when he spread those wings, those wings!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>So white that my eyes were blinded, thick-feathered and wide unfurled</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They beat the air into billows. We sailed, and the earth was gone.</div>
      <div class='line'>Canyon and desert and mesa withered below, with the world.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And then I knew that mustang; for I—was Bellerophon!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yes, glad as the Greek, and mounted on a horse of the elder gods,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With never a magic bridle or a fountain-mirror nigh!</div>
      <div class='line'><em>My chaps and spurs and holster must have looked it?</em> What’s the odds?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I’d a leg over lightning and thunder, careering across the sky!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And forever streaming before me, fanning my forehead cool,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Flowed a mane of molten silver; and just before my thighs</div>
      <div class='line'>(As I gripped his velvet-muscled ribs, while I cursed myself for a fool),</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The steady pulse of those pinions—their wonderful fall and rise!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The bandanna I bought in Bowie blew loose and whipped from my neck.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>My shirt was stuck to my shoulders and ribboning out behind.</div>
      <div class='line'>The stars were dancing, wheeling and glancing, dipping with smirk and beck.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The clouds were flowing, dusking and glowing. We rode a roaring wind.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>We soared through the silver starlight to knock at the planets’ gates.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>New shimmering constellations came whirling into our ken.</div>
      <div class='line'>Red stars and green and golden swung out of the void that waits</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For man’s great last adventure; the Signs took shape—and then</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I knew the lines of that Centaur the moment I saw him come!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The musical-box of the heavens all around us rolled to a tune</div>
      <div class='line'>That tinkled and chimed and trilled with silver sounds that struck you dumb,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As if some archangel were grinding out the music of the moon.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Melody-drunk on the Milky Way, as we swept and soared hilarious,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Full in our pathway, sudden he stood—the Centaur of the Stars,</div>
      <div class='line'>Flashing from head and hoofs and breast! I knew him for Sagittarius.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He reared, and bent and drew his bow. He crouched as a boxer spars.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Flung back on his haunches, weird he loomed—then leapt—and the dim void lightened.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Old White Wings shied and swerved aside, and fled from the splendor-shod.</div>
      <div class='line'>Through a flashing welter of worlds we charged. I knew why my horse was frightened.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He <em>had</em> two faces—a dog’s and a man’s—that Babylonian god!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Also, he followed us real as fear. Ping! went an arrow past.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>My broncho buck-jumped, humping high. We plunged&nbsp;... I guess that’s all!</div>
      <div class='line'>I lay on the purple canyon’s lip, when I opened my eyes at last—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Stiff and sore and my head like a drum, but I broke no bones in the fall.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So you know—and now you may string me up. Such was the way you caught me.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thank you for letting me tell it straight, though you never could greatly care.</div>
      <div class='line'>For I took a horse that wasn’t mine!... But there’s one the heavens brought me,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And I’ll hang right happy, because I know he is waiting for me up there.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From creamy muzzle to cannon-bone, by God, he’s a peerless wonder!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He is steel and velvet and furnace-fire, and death’s supremest prize;</div>
      <div class='line'>And never again shall be roped on earth that neck that is “clothed with thunder”&nbsp;...</div>
      <div class='line in2'>String me up, Dave! Go dig my grave! <em>I rode him across the skies!</em></div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Note.</span> <em>The last stanza in the first ballad sung is a fragment of an old
country song; the rest of it, with the other two ballads, is invented. But they
are all in the convention of songs still sung by strolling ballad-singers.
I have written the common word for pasture-field “paurk” so as not to give a
wrong association: it might be written “park,” as Burns, using the word in
the same sense, writes it. “Paurk” or “park” is Gaelic for pasture field,
and is always used in Irish country speech in that sense. The two last
lines spoken are translations of a Gaelic phrase which has been used by
Dr. Douglas Hyde as a motto for his collection of Connacht love songs. P. C.</em></p>

<p class='c017'><em>Liadain and Curithir were two poets who lived in Ireland in the seventh
century. They fell in love, but while Curithir was absent making preparations
for their marriage, Liadain, for some unexplained reason, took the
vows of a nun. Curithir in despair became a monk. At first they continued
to see each other, but when this led to the breaking of their vows, Curithir
left Liadain to spend his life in penance and thus save his soul.</em></p>

      <div class='line'>That sends the frozen ground-swell under it,</div>
      <div class='line'>And spills the upper boulders in the sun;</div>
      <div class='line'>And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.</div>
      <div class='line'>The work of hunters is another thing:</div>
      <div class='line'>I have come after them and made repair</div>
      <div class='line'>Where they have left not one stone on stone,</div>
      <div class='line'>But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,</div>
      <div class='line'>To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,</div>
      <div class='line'>No one has seen them made or heard them made,</div>
      <div class='line'>But at spring mending-time we find them there.</div>
      <div class='line'>I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;</div>
      <div class='line'>And on a day we meet to walk the line</div>
      <div class='line'>And set the wall between us once again.</div>
      <div class='line'>We keep the wall between us as we go.</div>
      <div class='line'>To each the boulders that have fallen to each.</div>
      <div class='line'>And some are loaves and some so nearly balls</div>
      <div class='line'>We have to use a spell to make them balance:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Stay where you are until our backs are turned!”</div>
      <div class='line'>We wear our fingers rough with handling them.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, just another kind of out-door game,</div>
      <div class='line'>One on a side. It comes to little more:</div>

      <div class='line'>Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder</div>
      <div class='line'>If I could put a notion in his head:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Why do they make good neighbors? Isn’t it</div>
      <div class='line'>Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Before I built a wall I’d ask to know</div>

      <div class='line'>Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,</div>
      <div class='line'>That wants it down.” I could say “Elves” to him,</div>
      <div class='line'>But it’s not elves exactly, and I’d rather</div>
      <div class='line'>He said it for himself. I see him there</div>
      <div class='line'>Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top</div>
      <div class='line'>In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.</div>
      <div class='line'>He moves in darkness as it seems to me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not of woods only and the shade of trees.</div>
      <div class='line'>He will not go behind his father’s saying,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he likes having thought of it so well</div>
      <div class='line'>He says again, “Good fences make good neighbors.”</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But once within the wood, we paused</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There were three in the meadow by the brook,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gathering up windrows, piling haycocks up,</div>
      <div class='line'>With an eye always lifted toward the west,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where an irregular, sun-bordered cloud</div>
      <div class='line'>Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger</div>
      <div class='line'>Flickering across its bosom. Suddenly</div>
      <div class='line'>One helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>Marched himself off the field and home. One stayed.</div>
      <div class='line'>The town-bred farmer failed to understand.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What was there wrong?</div>
      <div class='line in22'>Something you said just now.</div>
      <div class='line'>What did I say?</div>
      <div class='line in16'>About our taking pains.</div>
      <div class='line'>To cock the hay?—because it’s going to shower?</div>
      <div class='line'>I said that nearly half an hour ago.</div>
      <div class='line'>I said it to myself as much as you.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>You didn’t know. But James is one big fool.</div>
      <div class='line'>He thought you meant to find fault with his work.</div>
      <div class='line'>That’s what the average farmer would have meant.</div>
      <div class='line'>James had to take his time to chew it over</div>
      <div class='line'>Before he acted; he’s just got round to act.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He <em>is</em> a fool if that’s the way he takes me.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Don’t let it bother you. You’ve found out something.</div>
      <div class='line'>The hand that knows his business won’t be told</div>
      <div class='line'>To do work faster or better—those two things.</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m as particular as anyone:</div>
      <div class='line'>Most likely I’d have served you just the same:</div>
      <div class='line'>But I know you don’t understand our ways.</div>
      <div class='line'>You were just talking what was in your mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>What was in all our minds, and you weren’t hinting.</div>
      <div class='line'>Tell you a story of what happened once.</div>
      <div class='line'>I was up here in Salem, at a man’s</div>
      <div class='line'>Named Sanders, with a gang of four or five,</div>
      <div class='line'>Doing the haying. No one liked the boss.</div>
      <div class='line'>He was one of the kind sports call a spider,</div>
      <div class='line'>All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy</div>
      <div class='line'>From a humped body nigh as big as a biscuit.</div>
      <div class='line'>But work!—that man could work, especially</div>
      <div class='line'>If by so doing he could get more work</div>
      <div class='line'>Out of his hired help. I’m not denying</div>
      <div class='line'>He was hard on himself: I couldn’t find</div>
      <div class='line'>That he kept any hours—not for himself.</div>
      <div class='line'>Day-light and lantern-light were one to him:</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ve heard him pounding in the barn all night.</div>
      <div class='line'>But what he liked was someone to encourage.</div>
      <div class='line'>Them that he couldn’t lead he’d get behind</div>
      <div class='line'>And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing—</div>
      <div class='line'>Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off.</div>
      <div class='line'>I’d seen about enough of his bulling tricks—</div>
      <div class='line'>We call that bulling. I’d been watching him.</div>
      <div class='line'>So when he paired off with me in the hayfield</div>
      <div class='line'>To load the load, thinks I, look out for trouble!</div>
      <div class='line'>I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders</div>
      <div class='line'>Combed it down with the rake and said, “O. K.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Everything went right till we reached the barn</div>
      <div class='line'>With a big take to empty in a bay.</div>
      <div class='line'>You understand that meant the easy job</div>
      <div class='line'>For the man up on top of throwing down</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>The hay and rolling it off wholesale,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where, on a mow, it would have been slow lifting.</div>
      <div class='line'>You wouldn’t think a fellow’d need much urging</div>
      <div class='line'>Under those circumstances, would you now?</div>
      <div class='line'>But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands,</div>
      <div class='line'>And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shouts like an army captain, “Let her come!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Thinks I, d’ye mean it? “What was that you said?”</div>
      <div class='line'>I asked out loud so’s there’d be no mistake.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Did you say, let her come?” “Yes, let her come.”</div>
      <div class='line'>He said it over, but he said it softer.</div>
      <div class='line'>Never you say a thing like that to a man,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not if he values what he is. God, I’d as soon</div>
      <div class='line'>Murdered him as left out his middle name.</div>
      <div class='line'>I’d built the load and knew just where to find it.</div>
      <div class='line'>Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for</div>
      <div class='line'>Like meditating, and then I just dug in</div>
      <div class='line'>And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots.</div>
      <div class='line'>I looked over the side once in the dust</div>
      <div class='line'>And caught sight of him treading-water-like,</div>
      <div class='line'>Keeping his head above. “Damn ye,” I says,</div>
      <div class='line'>“That gets ye!” He squeaked like a squeezed rat.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>That was the last I saw or heard of him.</div>
      <div class='line'>I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off.</div>
      <div class='line'>As I sat mopping the hayseed from my neck,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sort of waiting to be asked about it,</div>
      <div class='line'>One of the boys sings out, “Where’s the old man?”</div>
      <div class='line'>“I left him in the barn, under the hay.</div>
      <div class='line'>If you want him you can go and dig him out.”</div>
      <div class='line'>They realized from the way I swobbed my neck</div>
      <div class='line'>More than was needed, something must be up.</div>
      <div class='line'>They headed for the barn—I stayed where I was.</div>
      <div class='line'>They told me afterward: First they forked hay,</div>
      <div class='line'>A lot of it, out into the barn floor.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle!</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>I guess they thought I’d spiked him in the temple</div>
      <div class='line'>Before I buried him, else I couldn’t have managed.</div>
      <div class='line'>They excavated more. “Go keep his wife</div>
      <div class='line'>Out of the barn.”</div>
      <div class='line in18'>Some one looked in a window;</div>
      <div class='line'>And curse me, if he wasn’t in the kitchen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet</div>
      <div class='line'>Stuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer.</div>
      <div class='line'>He looked so mad in back, and so disgusted</div>
      <div class='line'>There was no one that dared to stir him up</div>
      <div class='line'>Or let him know that he was being looked at.</div>
      <div class='line'>Apparently I hadn’t buried him</div>
      <div class='line'>(I may have knocked him down), but just my trying</div>
      <div class='line'>To bury him had hurt his dignity.</div>
      <div class='line'>He had gone to the house so’s not to face me.</div>
      <div class='line'>He kept away from us all afternoon.</div>
      <div class='line'>We tended to his hay. We saw him out</div>
      <div class='line'>After a while picking peas in the garden:</div>
      <div class='line'>He couldn’t keep away from doing something.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Weren’t you relieved to find he wasn’t dead?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No!—and yet I can’t say: it’s hard to tell.</div>
      <div class='line'>I went about to kill him fair enough.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>You took an awkward way. Did he discharge you?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Discharge me? No! He knew I did just right.</div>

      <div class='line'>The little doll-faced children</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>With their lanterns full of moon-fire,</div>
      <div class='line'>That came from all the empire</div>
      <div class='line'>Honoring the throne?—</div>
      <div class='line'>The loveliest fête and carnival</div>
      <div class='line'>Our world had ever known?</div>
      <div class='line'>The sages sat about us</div>
      <div class='line'>With their heads bowed in their beards,</div>
      <div class='line'>With proper meditation on the sight.</div>
      <div class='line'>Confucius was not born;</div>
      <div class='line'>We lived in those great days</div>
      <div class='line'>Confucius later said were lived aright&nbsp;...</div>
      <div class='line'>And this gray bird, on that day of spring,</div>
      <div class='line'>With a bright-bronze breast and a bronze-brown wing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Captured the world with his carolling.</div>
      <div class='line'>Late at night his tune was spent.</div>
      <div class='line'>Peasants,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sages,</div>
      <div class='line'>Children,</div>
      <div class='line'>Homeward went,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then the bronze bird sang for you and me.</div>
      <div class='line'>We walked alone, our hearts were high and free.</div>
      <div class='line'>I had a silvery name, I had a silvery name,</div>
      <div class='line'>I had a silvery name—do you remember</div>
      <div class='line'>The name you cried beside the tumbling sea?”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Chang turned not to the lady slim—</div>
      <div class='line'>He bent to his work, ironing away;</div>
      <div class='line'>But she was arch and knowing and glowing.</div>
      <div class='line'>And the bird on his shoulder spoke for him.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“Darling&nbsp;... darling&nbsp;... darling&nbsp;... darling&nbsp;...”</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The great gray joss on a rustic shelf,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rakish and shrewd, with his collar awry,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sang impolitely, as though by himself,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Drowning with his bellowing the nightingale’s cry:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Back through a hundred, hundred years</div>
      <div class='line'>Hear the waves as they climb the piers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hear the howl of the silver seas,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hear the thunder!</div>
      <div class='line'>Hear the gongs of holy China</div>
      <div class='line'>How the waves and tunes combine</div>
      <div class='line'>In a rhythmic clashing wonder,</div>
      <div class='line'>Incantation old and fine:</div>

      <div class='line in2'>And dragons, dragons, Chinese dragons.’”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then the lady, rosy-red,</div>
      <div class='line'>Turned to her lover Chang and said:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Dare you forget that turquoise dawn</div>
      <div class='line'>When we stood in our mist-hung velvet lawn,</div>
      <div class='line'>And worked a spell this great joss taught</div>
      <div class='line'>Till a God of the Dragons was charmed and caught?</div>
      <div class='line'>From the flag high over our palace-home</div>
      <div class='line'>He flew to our feet in rainbow-foam—</div>
      <div class='line'>A king of beauty and tempest and thunder</div>
      <div class='line'>Panting to tear our sorrows asunder,</div>
      <div class='line'>A dragon of fair adventure and wonder.</div>
      <div class='line'>We mounted the back of that royal slave</div>
      <div class='line'>With thoughts of desire that were noble and grave.</div>
      <div class='line'>We swam down the shore to the dragon-mountains,</div>
      <div class='line'>We whirled to the peaks and the fiery fountains.</div>
      <div class='line'>To our secret ivory house we were borne.</div>
      <div class='line'>We looked down the wonderful wing-filled regions</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the dragons darted in glimmering legions.</div>
      <div class='line'>Right by my breast the nightingale sang;</div>
      <div class='line'>The old rhymes rang in the sunlit mist</div>
      <div class='line'>That we this hour regain—</div>
      <div class='line'>Song-fire for the brain.</div>
      <div class='line'>When my hands and my hair and my feet you kissed,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>When you cried for your heart’s new pain,</div>
      <div class='line'>What was my name in the dragon-mist,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the rings of rainbowed rain?”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“Sorrow and love, glory and love,”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Said the Chinese nightingale.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Sorrow and love, glory and love,”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Said the Chinese nightingale.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And now the joss broke in with his song:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Dying ember, bird of Chang,</div>
      <div class='line'>Soul of Chang, do you remember?—</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere you returned to the shining harbor</div>
      <div class='line'>There were pirates by ten thousand</div>
      <div class='line'>Descended on the town</div>
      <div class='line'>In vessels mountain-high and red and brown,</div>
      <div class='line'>Moon-ships that climbed the storms and cut the skies.</div>
      <div class='line'>On their prows were painted terrible bright eyes.</div>
      <div class='line'>But I was then a wizard and a scholar and a priest;</div>
      <div class='line'>I stood upon the sand;</div>
      <div class='line'>With lifted hand I looked upon them</div>
      <div class='line'>And sunk their vessels with my wizard eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the stately lacquer-gate made safe again.</div>
      <div class='line'>Deep, deep below the bay, the sea-weed and the spray,</div>
      <div class='line'>Embalmed in amber every pirate lies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Embalmed in amber every pirate lies.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then this did the noble lady say:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Bird, do you dream of our home-coming day</div>
      <div class='line'>When you flew like a courier on before</div>
      <div class='line'>From the dragon-peak to our palace-door,</div>
      <div class='line'>And we drove the steed in your singing path—</div>
      <div class='line'>The ramping dragon of laughter and wrath;</div>
      <div class='line'>And found our city all aglow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And knighted this joss that decked it so?</div>
      <div class='line'>There were golden fishes in the purple river</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>And silver fishes and rainbow fishes.</div>
      <div class='line'>There were golden junks in the laughing river,</div>
      <div class='line'>And silver junks and rainbow junks:</div>
      <div class='line'>There were golden lilies by the bay and river,</div>
      <div class='line'>And silver lilies and tiger-lilies,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tinkling wind-bells in the gardens of the town</div>
      <div class='line'>By the black-lacquer gate</div>
      <div class='line'>Where walked in state</div>
      <div class='line'>The kind king Chang</div>
      <div class='line'>And his sweetheart mate&nbsp;...</div>
      <div class='line'>With his flag-born dragon</div>
      <div class='line'>And his crown of pearl&nbsp;... and&nbsp;... jade;</div>
      <div class='line'>And his nightingale reigning in the mulberry shade,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sailors and soldiers on the sea-sands brown,</div>
      <div class='line'>And priests who bowed them down to your song—</div>
      <div class='line'>By the city called Han, the peacock town,</div>
      <div class='line'>By the city called Han, the nightingale town,</div>
      <div class='line'>The nightingale town.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then sang the bird, so strangely gay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fluttering, fluttering, ghostly and gray,</div>
      <div class='line'>A vague, unravelling, answering tune,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a long unwinding silk cocoon;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sang as though for the soul of him</div>
      <div class='line'>Who ironed away in that bower dim:</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Dim is your proud lost palace-gate.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I vaguely know</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There were heroes of old,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>There were ghostly veils and laces&nbsp;...</div>

      <div class='line in2'>With lovers’ ardent faces</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Bending to one another,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Speaking each his part.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They infinitely echo</div>

      <div class='line in2'>‘Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart!’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They said to one another.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They spoke, I think, of perils past.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They spoke, I think, of peace at last.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>One thing I remember:</div>

      <div class='line'>I walk down the garden paths,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the daffodils</div>
      <div class='line'>Are blowing, and the bright blue squills.</div>
      <div class='line'>I walk down the patterned garden paths</div>
      <div class='line'>In my stiff, brocaded gown.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>With my powdered hair and jewelled fan,</div>

      <div class='line'>My dress is richly figured,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the train</div>
      <div class='line'>Makes a pink and silver stain</div>
      <div class='line'>On the gravel, and the thrift</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the borders.</div>
      <div class='line'>Just a plate of current fashion,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes.</div>
      <div class='line'>Not a softness anywhere about me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Only whale-bone and brocade.</div>
      <div class='line'>And I sink on a seat in the shade</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a lime tree. For my passion</div>
      <div class='line'>Wars against the stiff brocade.</div>
      <div class='line'>The daffodils and squills</div>

      <div class='line'>And the plashing of waterdrops</div>
      <div class='line'>In the marble fountain</div>

      <div class='line'>The dripping never stops.</div>
      <div class='line'>Underneath my stiffened gown</div>
      <div class='line'>Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin,</div>
      <div class='line'>A basin in the midst of hedges grown</div>
      <div class='line'>So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding,</div>
      <div class='line'>But she guesses he is near,</div>

      <div class='line'>A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till he caught me in the shade,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Aching, melting, unafraid.</div>
      <div class='line'>With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the plopping of the waterdrops,</div>
      <div class='line'>All about us in the open afternoon—</div>
      <div class='line'>I am very like to swoon</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The throats of the little red trumpet-flowers are wide open,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the clangor of brass beats against the hot sunlight.</div>
      <div class='line'>They bray and blare at the burning sky.</div>
      <div class='line'>Red! Red! Coarse notes of red,</div>
      <div class='line'>Trumpeted at the blue sky.</div>
      <div class='line'>In long streaks of sound, molten metal,</div>
      <div class='line'>The vine declares itself.</div>
      <div class='line'>Clang!—from its red and yellow trumpets.</div>
      <div class='line'>Clang!—from its long, nasal trumpets,</div>
      <div class='line'>Splitting the sunlight into ribbons, tattered and shot with noise.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I sit in the cool arbor, in a green and gold twilight.</div>
      <div class='line'>It is very still, for I cannot hear the trumpets;</div>
      <div class='line'>I only know that they are red and open,</div>
      <div class='line'>And that the sun above the arbor shakes with heat.</div>
      <div class='line'>My quill is newly mended,</div>
      <div class='line'>And makes fine-drawn lines with its point.</div>
      <div class='line'>Down the long white paper it makes little lines,</div>
      <div class='line'>Just lines,—up—down—criss-cross.</div>
      <div class='line'>My heart is strained out at the pin-point of my quill;</div>
      <div class='line'>It is thin and writhing like the marks of the pen.</div>
      <div class='line'>My hand marches to a squeaky tune,</div>
      <div class='line'>It marches down the paper to a squealing of fifes.</div>
      <div class='line'>My pen and the trumpet-flowers,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Washington’s armies away over the smoke-tree to the southwest.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Yankee Doodle,” my darling! It is you against the British,</div>
      <div class='line'>Marching in your ragged shoes to batter down King George.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>What have you got in your hat? Not a feather, I wager.</div>
      <div class='line'>Just a hay-straw, for it is the harvest you are fighting for.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hay in your hat, and the whites of their eyes for a target!</div>
      <div class='line'>Like Bunker Hill, two years ago, when I watched all day from the housetop,</div>
      <div class='line'>Through father’s spy-glass,</div>
      <div class='line'>The red city, and the blue, bright water,</div>
      <div class='line'>And puffs of smoke which you made.</div>
      <div class='line'>Twenty miles away,</div>
      <div class='line'>Round by Cambridge, or over the Neck,</div>
      <div class='line'>But the smoke was white—white!</div>
      <div class='line'>To-day the trumpet-flowers are red—red—</div>

red, festooning from the ceiling like stalactites of blood, flooding

their claret and salmon into the teeth of the sleet, plopping their
little round maroon lights upon the tops of umbrellas.</p>

<p class='c006'>The row of white, sparkling shop-fronts is gashed and bleeding,
it bleeds red slippers. They spout under the electric light, fluid
and fluctuating, a hot rain—and freeze again to red slippers,
myriadly multiplied in the mirror side of the window.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>They balance upon arched insteps like springing bridges of
crimson lacquer; they swing up over curved heels like whirling
tanagers sucked in a wind-pocket; they flatten out, heelless, like
July ponds, flared and burnished by red rockets.</p>

<p class='c007'>Snap, snap, they are cracker sparks of scarlet in the white,
monotonous block of shops.</p>

<p class='c007'>They plunge the clangor of billions of vermilion trumpets into
the crowd outside, and echo in faint rose over the pavement.</p>

<p class='c006'>People hurry by, for these are only shoes, and in a window farther
down is a big lotus bud of cardboard, whose petals open every
few minutes and reveal a wax doll, with staring bead eyes and
flaxen hair, lolling awkwardly in its flower chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>One has often seen shoes, but whoever saw a cardboard lotus
bud before?</p>

<p class='c006'>The flaws of gray, windy sleet beat on the shop-window where
there are only red slippers.</p>

      <div class='line'>And slowly we advanced together),</div>
      <div class='line'>He said: “I bring you your inheritance.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I watched his eyes; they were dim.</div>
      <div class='line'>I doubted him, watched him, doubted him&nbsp;...</div>
      <div class='line'>But, in a ceremonious way,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So, without another word,</div>
      <div class='line'>We two jaunted on the street.</div>

      <div class='line'>On his face, and we muttered along the street,</div>
      <div class='line'>Good enough friends, on the usual beat.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>We lived together long, long.</div>
      <div class='line'>We were always alone, he and I.</div>
      <div class='line'>We never smiled with each other;</div>

      <div class='line'>As every man in the world might do.</div>
      <div class='line'>He who lies all night in bed</div>
      <div class='line'>Is a fool, and midnight will crush his head.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>But in a short space</div>
      <div class='line'>We came back to each other melancholy-hearted,</div>
      <div class='line'>Told our pain,</div>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>So we spat in their faces,</div>

      <div class='line'>The telegraph tickers sounding their perpetual chit—chit-chit from the uttermost ends of the earth.</div>

      <div class='line'>The white-tiled, immaculate kitchen, with many little round blue fires, where white-clad cooks are making spiced and flavored dishes.</div>
      <div class='line'>The cool cellars filled with meats and fruits, or layered with sealed and bottled wines mellowing softly in the darkness.</div>
      <div class='line'>The invisible stories of furnaces and machines, burrowing deep into the earth, where grimy workmen are heavily laboring.</div>
      <div class='line'>The many-windowed stories of little homes and shelters and sleeping-places, reaching up into the night like some miraculous, high-piled honey-comb of wax-white cells.</div>
      <div class='line'>The clothes inside of the cells—the stuffs, the silks, the laces; the elaborate delicate disguises that wait in trunks and drawers and closets, or bedrape and conceal human flesh.</div>
      <div class='line'>The people inside of the clothes, the bodies white and young, bodies fat and bulging, bodies wrinkled and wan, all alike veiled by fine fabrics, sheltered by walls and roofs, shut in from the sun and stars.</div>

      <div class='line'>So-Kin of Rakuho, ancient friend, I now remember</div>
      <div class='line'>That you built me a special tavern,</div>

      <div class='line'>With yellow gold and white jewels</div>
      <div class='line in20'>we paid for the songs and laughter,</div>
      <div class='line'>And we were drunk for month after month,</div>
      <div class='line in20'>forgetting the kings and princes.</div>
      <div class='line'>Intelligent men came drifting in, from the sea</div>
      <div class='line in20'>and from the west border,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with them, and with you especially,</div>
      <div class='line in20'>there was nothing at cross-purpose;</div>
      <div class='line'>And they made nothing of sea-crossing</div>
      <div class='line in20'>or of mountain-crossing,</div>
      <div class='line'>If only they could be of that fellowship.</div>
      <div class='line'>And we all spoke out our hearts and minds&nbsp;...</div>
      <div class='line in20'>and without regret.</div>
      <div class='line'>And then I was sent off to South Wei,</div>
      <div class='line in20'>smothered in laurel groves,</div>
      <div class='line'>And you to the north of Raku-hoku,</div>

      <div class='line'>We met, and travelled together into Sen-Go</div>
      <div class='line'>Through all the thirty-six folds of the turning and twisting waters;</div>
      <div class='line'>Into a valley of a thousand bright flowers&nbsp;...</div>
      <div class='line in20'>that was the first valley,</div>
      <div class='line'>And on into ten thousand valleys</div>
      <div class='line in20'>full of voices and pine-winds.</div>
      <div class='line'>With silver harness and reins of gold,</div>
      <div class='line in20'>prostrating themselves on the ground,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Out came the East-of-Kan foreman and his company;</div>
      <div class='line'>And there came also the “True-man” of Shi-yo to meet me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Playing on a jewelled mouth-organ.</div>
      <div class='line'>In the storied houses of San-Ko they gave us</div>
      <div class='line in20'>more Sennin music;</div>
      <div class='line'>Many instruments, like the sound of young phœnix broods.</div>
      <div class='line'>And the foreman of Kan-Chu, drunk,</div>
      <div class='line'>Danced because his long sleeves</div>
      <div class='line'>Wouldn’t keep still, with that music playing.</div>
      <div class='line'>And I, wrapped in brocade, went to sleep with my head on his lap,</div>
      <div class='line'>And my spirit so high that it was all over the heavens.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And before the end of the day we were scattered like stars or rain.</div>
      <div class='line'>I had to be off to So, far away over the waters,</div>
      <div class='line'>You back to your river-bridge.</div>
      <div class='line'>And your father, who was brave as a leopard,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was governor in Hei Shu and put down the barbarian rabble.</div>
      <div class='line'>And one May he had you send for me, despite the long distance;</div>
      <div class='line'>And what with broken wheels and so on, I won’t say it wasn’t hard going&nbsp;...</div>
      <div class='line'>Over roads twisted like sheep’s guts.</div>

      <div class='line'>Then what a reception!</div>
      <div class='line'>Red jade cups, food well set, on a blue jewelled table;</div>
      <div class='line'>And I was drunk, and had no thought of returning;</div>
      <div class='line'>And you would walk out with me to the western corner of the castle,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the dynastic temple, with the water about it clear as blue jade,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>With ripples like dragon-scales going grass-green on the water,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleasure lasting, with courtezans going and coming without hindrance,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the willow-flakes falling like snow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the vermilioned girls getting drunk about sunset,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the waters a hundred feet deep reflecting green eyebrows—</div>

      <div class='line'>Gracefully painted—and the girls singing back at each other,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dancing in transparent brocade,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the wind lifting the song, and interrupting it,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tossing it up under the clouds.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>And all this comes to an end,</div>
      <div class='line'>And is not again to be met with.</div>
      <div class='line'>I went up to the court for examination,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tried Layu’s luck, offered the Choyu song,</div>
      <div class='line'>And got no promotion,</div>
      <div class='line'>And went back to the East Mountains white-headed.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And once again we met, later, at the South Bridge head.</div>
      <div class='line'>And then the crowd broke up—you went north to San palace.</div>
      <div class='line'>And if you ask how I regret that parting?</div>
      <div class='line'>It is like the flowers falling at spring’s end,</div>
      <div class='line in20'>confused, whirled in a tangle.</div>
      <div class='line'>What is the use of talking! And there is no end of talking—</div>
      <div class='line'>There is no end of things in the heart.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I call in the boy,</div>

      <div class='line'>Three days I heard them grieve when I lay dead,</div>
      <div class='line'>(It was so strange to me that they should weep!)</div>
      <div class='line'>Tall candles burned about me in the dark,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a great crucifix was on my breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a great silence filled the lonesome room.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I heard one whisper, “Lo! the dawn is breaking,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he has lost the wonder of the day.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Another came whom I had loved on earth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And kissed my brow and brushed my dampened hair.</div>
      <div class='line'>Softly she spoke: “Oh, that he should not see</div>
      <div class='line'>The April that his spirit bathed in! Birds</div>
      <div class='line'>Are singing in the orchard, and the grass</div>
      <div class='line'>That soon will cover him is growing green.</div>
      <div class='line'>The daisies whiten on the emerald hills,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the immortal magic that he loved</div>
      <div class='line'>Wakens again—and he has fallen asleep.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Another said: “Last night I saw the moon</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a tremendous lantern shine in heaven,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I could only think of him—and sob.</div>
      <div class='line'>For I remembered evenings wonderful</div>
      <div class='line'>When he was faint with Life’s sad loveliness,</div>
      <div class='line'>And watched the silver ribbons wandering far</div>
      <div class='line'>Along the shore, and out upon the sea.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, I remembered how he loved the world,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sighing ocean and the flaming stars,</div>
      <div class='line'>The everlasting glamour God has given—</div>
      <div class='line'>His tapestries that wrap the earth’s wide room.</div>
      <div class='line'>I minded me of mornings filled with rain</div>
      <div class='line'>When he would sit and listen to the sound</div>
      <div class='line'>As if it were lost music from the spheres.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>He loved the crocus and the hawthorn-hedge,</div>

      <div class='line'>That boomed across the meadows. He was glad</div>
      <div class='line'>At dawn or sundown; glad when Autumn came</div>
      <div class='line'>With her worn livery and scarlet crown,</div>
      <div class='line'>And glad when Winter rocked the earth to rest.</div>

      <div class='line'>There was no darkness where my spirit flew,</div>
      <div class='line'>There was no night beyond the teeming world.</div>
      <div class='line'>Their April was like winter where I roamed;</div>

      <div class='line'>Whom God had snatched from penury and pain</div>
      <div class='line'>To draw across the barricades of heaven.</div>
      <div class='line'>I clomb beyond the sun, beyond the moon;</div>
      <div class='line'>In flight on flight I touched the highest star;</div>
      <div class='line'>I plunged to regions where the Spring is born,</div>
      <div class='line'>Myself (I asked not how) the April wind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Myself the elements that are of God.</div>
      <div class='line'>Up flowery stairways of eternity</div>
      <div class='line'>I whirled in wonder and untrammeled joy,</div>

      <div class='line'>The soul of the returning April grass,</div>
      <div class='line'>The spirit of the evening and the dawn,</div>
      <div class='line'>The perfume in unnumbered hawthorn-blooms.</div>
      <div class='line'>There was no shadow on my perfect peace,</div>
      <div class='line'>No knowledge that was hidden from my heart.</div>
      <div class='line'>I learned what music meant; I read the years;</div>
      <div class='line'>I found where rainbows hide, where tears begin;</div>

<h3 class='c013'>SCENTED LEAVES FROM A CHINESE JAR</h3>

<h4 class='c013'>THE ACACIA LEAVES</h4>

<p class='c017'>The aged man, when he beheld winter approaching, counted
the leaves as they lapsed from the acacia trees; while his son was
talking of the spring.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE BITTER PURPLE WILLOWS</h4>

<p class='c017'>Meditating on the glory of illustrious lineage I lifted up my eyes
and beheld the bitter purple willows growing round the tombs of
the exalted Mings.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>
  <h4 class='c013'>THE CORAL FISHER</h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The coral fisher, who had been a long time beneath the water,
rose to the surface with nothing in his hand but a spray of crimson
seaweed. In answer to the master of the junk he said, “While I
was in the world of fishes this miserable weed appeared to me more
beautiful than coral.”</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE DIAMOND</h4>

<p class='c017'>The poet Wong, after he had delighted a company of mandarins
at a feast, sat silent in the midst of his household. He explained,
“The diamond sparkles only when it is in the light.”</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE ESTUARY</h4>

<p class='c017'>Some one complained to the Master, “After many lessons I do
not fully understand your doctrine.” In response the Master
pointed to the tide in the mouth of the river, and asked, “How
wide is the sea in this place?”</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE INTOXICATED POET</h4>

<p class='c017'>A poet, having taken the bridle off his tongue, spoke thus:
“More fragrant than the heliotrope, which blooms all the year
round, better than vermilion letters on tablets of sendal, are thy
kisses, thou shy one!”</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE JONQUILS</h4>

<p class='c017'>I have heard that a certain princess, when she found that she
had been married by a demon, wove a wreath of jonquils and sent
it to the lover of former days.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE MARIGOLD</h4>

<p class='c017'>Even as the seed of the marigold, carried by the wind, lodges
on the roofs of palaces, and lights the air with flame-colored
blossoms, so may the child-like words of the insignificant poet
confer honor on lofty and disdainful mandarins.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>
  <h4 class='c013'>THE MERMAID</h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The sailor boy who leant over the side of the Junk of Many
Pearls, and combed the green tresses of the sea with his ivory
fingers, believing that he had heard the voice of a mermaid, cast
his body down between the waves.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE MIDDLE KINGDOM</h4>

<p class='c017'>The emperors of fourteen dynasties, clad in robes of yellow silk
embroidered with the Dragon, wearing gold diadems set with
pearls and rubies, and seated on thrones of incomparable ivory,
have ruled over the Middle Kingdom for four thousand years.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE MILKY WAY</h4>

<p class='c017'>My mother taught me that every night a procession of junks
carrying lanterns moves silently across the sky, and the water
sprinkled from their paddles falls to the earth in the form of dew.
I no longer believe that the stars are junks carrying lanterns, no
longer that the dew is shaken from their oars.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE ONION</h4>

<p class='c017'>The child who threw away leaf after leaf of the many-coated
onion, to get to the sweet heart, found in the end that he had
thrown away the heart itself.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE SEA-SHELL</h4>

<p class='c017'>To the passionate lover, whose sighs come back to him on every
breeze, all the world is like a murmuring sea-shell.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE STUPID KITE</h4>

<p class='c017'>A kite, while devouring a skylark, complained, “Had I known
that thy flesh was no sweeter than that of a sparrow I should have
listened longer to thy delicious notes.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>
  <h4 class='c013'>THE WINDMILL</h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The exquisite painter Ko-tsu was often reproached by an industrious
friend for his fits of idleness. At last he excused himself
by saying, “You are a watermill—a windmill can grind only when
the wind blows.”</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE WORD</h4>

<p class='c017'>The first time the emperor Han heard a certain Word he said,
“It is strange.” The second time he said, “It is divine.” The
third time he said, “Let the speaker be put to death.”</p>

      <div class='line'>Green afternoon serene and bright, along my street you sail away</div>
      <div class='line'>Sun-dappled like a ship of light that glints upon a rippled bay.</div>
      <div class='line'>Afar, freight-engines call and toll; the sprays flash on the fragrant grass;</div>
      <div class='line'>The children and the nurses stroll; the charging motors plunge and pass.</div>
      <div class='line'>Invisibly the shadows grow, empurpling in a rising tide</div>
      <div class='line'>The walks where light-gowned women go, white curb, gray asphalt iris-dyed.</div>
      <div class='line'>A jolting trolley shrills afar; nasturtiums blow, and ivy vines;</div>
      <div class='line'>Wet scents of turf and black-smoothed tar float down the rooftrees’ vergent lines.</div>
      <div class='line'>Where will you go, my afternoon, that glints so still and swift away,</div>
      <div class='line'>Blue-shaded like a ship of light bound outward from a wimpled bay?</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh—thrilling, pulsing, dark and bright, shall you, your work, your pain, your mirth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fly into the immortal night and silence of our mother earth?</div>
      <div class='line'>She bore all Eden’s green and dew, and Persia’s scented wine and rose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, flowering white against the blue, acanthus leaf and marbled pose.</div>
      <div class='line'>And deep the Maenad’s choric dance, Crusader’s cross, and heathen crest</div>
      <div class='line'>Lie sunk with rose and song and lance all veiled and vanished in her breast.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And all those afternoons once danced and sparkled in the sapphire light</div>
      <div class='line'>And iris shade as you have glanced, green afternoon, in vibrant flight.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>As, down dim vistas, echoing, dead afternoons entreat our days,</div>
      <div class='line'>What breath of beauty will you sing to souls unseen and unknown ways?</div>
      <div class='line'>How close and how unanswering, green afternoon, you pulse away,</div>
      <div class='line'>So little and so great a thing—deep towards the bourne of every day.</div>

  <h2 class='c005'>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The editors desire to express their thanks to the poets represented
in this anthology; also to the publishers of books marked with an asterisk
(*), and to the editors and publishers of magazines listed below,
for their very kind permission to use the poems here reprinted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The endeavor has been to list below all the books of verse, or books
about poetry, thus far printed by the poets quoted in this anthology:
and then to refer the reader to magazines which first published the
quoted poems, and to some of the anthologies which have included them.
It has been impossible, however, to note in every case the magazine in
which a poem was first printed, the records not being included in the
volumes from which they are taken; but we have tried to credit especially
certain periodicals which make a specialty of this subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>A recent revision of the bibliography, for the ninth edition, enables
the editors to include all titles of books published up to Oct. 1st, 1919.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
